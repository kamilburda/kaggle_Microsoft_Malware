# kaggle_Microsoft_Malware

Code that won [Kaggle Microsoft Malware Classification Competition] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification). Great credits go to team mate [daxiongshu](https://github.com/daxiongshu)
for organizing everything!

Please see the PDF for our methods and running the code. It heavily used [XGBOOST] (https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost).

This is a fork of the original winning code ported to Python 3 with updated dependencies.
This fork requires Python 3.6.1 to run properly.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. (Optional, highly recommended) Create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
3. Install the required packages:

       python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Install [pypy](https://www.pypy.org/) for Python 3
5. Set up your PATH variable so that `pypy` points to the executable that runs pypy (so that pypy may be run as `pypy [arguments]` without specifying the full path to pypy)

# Usage

To train a model and perform predictions, [see the PDF](Saynotooverfitting.pdf).

If you performed a custom split of the dataset into a train and a test set and you want to assess the prediction performance,
run

    prediction_performance.py [path to predictions] [path to true labels]

where `[path to predictions]` is a path to the CSV containing predictions generated by one of the models,
and `[path to true labels]` is a path to the CSV containing test labels
(having the same structure as the CSV for the train labels on the Kaggle site).
